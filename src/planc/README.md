# Parallel Low-rank Approximation with Nonnegativity Constraints (PLANC)

Given an input matrix A, Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is about determining two nonnegative matrices called factors, corresponding to the rows and columns of A respectively,  such that the product of them closely approximates A. In recent times, there is a huge interest for nonnegative factorizations for data with more than two modes, which can be represented via a generalization of matrices known as tensors. There are wide applications of nonnegative matrix and tensor factorization (NTF) in the scientific community such as spectral unmixing, compressing scientific data, scientific visualization, inverse problems, feature engineering for deep learning etc., as the factors are scientifically interpretable and an important cornerstone for explainable AI and representation learning. Similarly for internet applications such as topic modeling, background separation from video data, hyper-spectral imaging, web-scale clustering, and community detection.  There are many popular algorithms of NMF and NTF such as multiplicative update (MU), hierarchical alternating least squares (HALS), ANLS/BPP etc., and it was a technically highly complex task for scaling them to large number of processor to handle the internet scale scientific data.

PLANC delivers the high performance, flexibility, and scalability necessary to tackle the ever-growing size of today's internet and scientific data sets. Rather than developing separate software for each problem domain, algorithm and mathematical technique, flexibility has been achieved by characterizing nearly all of the current NMF and NTF algorithms in the context of a Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) framework.

In this repository, we offer highly tuned MPI and OpenMP implementation for MU, HALS, Nesterov, ADMM and ANLS/BPP based NMF and NTF algorithms that delivers the high performance, flexibility, and scalability necessary to tackle the ever-growing size of today's internet and scientific data sets. This can run off the shelf as well easy to integrate in other source code. We have tested
this software in [NERSC](http://www.nersc.gov/users/computational-systems/edison/), [OLCF](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/), and [PACE](https://pace.gatech.edu/) clusters. The OpenMP implementation is tested on many different linux variants with Intel processors. The library works well for both sparse and dense matrix. 

The following variants of matrix and tensor approximations are supported.
* [Shared Memory NMF](nmf/README.md) 
* [Distributed Memory NMF](distnmf/README.md)
* [Shared Memory NTF](ntf/README.md)
* [Distributed Memory NTF](distntf/README.md)
