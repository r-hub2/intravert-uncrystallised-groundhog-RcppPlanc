\description{
The two datasets, namingly \code{ctrl.sparse} and \code{stim.sparse}, are 
single-cell transcriptomic data preprocessed and subsampled from the study
of Hyun Min Kang and et al., Nat Biotech., 2018. The raw datasets were two
sparse matrices of integer values indicating the counts of genes (rows) per
cell (columns). We normalized each column of both matrices by its library 
size (sum), and selected common variable genes across the datasets. Finally,
we scaled the genes without centering them, in order to keep the 
non-negativity. The processed datasets were then randomly subsampled for a
minimal example.
